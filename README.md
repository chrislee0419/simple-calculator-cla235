# Simple Calculator

A personal project of mine to try out Android programming.
This calculator takes in 2 ten digit numbers and performs one of the four basic arithmetic operations.
### Functionality
- Numbers are converted from strings to floats, computed to produce a float or an int, and then displayed again as a string
- Can repeat operations on a result using the equals button
- Allows use of computed result in the next calculation (but no specifc button for the previous answer)
- Operations are done immediately after receiving two numbers (cannot do multiple operations/BEDMAS)
